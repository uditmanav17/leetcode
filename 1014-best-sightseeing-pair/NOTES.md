The goal is to keep track of:
​
* Maximum So far and add it to the cur_cell and maintain maximum result
* Here, max_so_far contains : A[i] + i
​
**Original Given Formula : A[i] + A[j] + i - j**
​
* Break in two parts : A[i] + i and A[j] -j
* Keep MAX_VALUE of first part among the elements seen so far
* Add the current element to max_so_far and check the result is changing or not
* Also, keep updating the max_so_far at each step
