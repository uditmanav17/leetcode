- for n=1
- ans =1 bcuz (P1,D1)
- for n=2
- we will try to add (P2,D2) to the existing pair (P1,D1)
- P2,D2 can come in these places together:`__P1D1, P1__D1, P1D1__`
- so now the ans = 3
- now lets check for P2 and D2 seprately
- fix P2 before P1 (P2P1D1) and places where D2 can come are:`P2P1_D1, P2P1D1_ P` (total 2 places)
- so ans = 3+2=5
- now fix P2 after P1 (P1P2D2) and places where D2 can come are: `P1P2D1_` (total 1 place)
- **so ans = 3+2+1 = 6**
- **where we can observe ans is coming as sum of no. till 3**
- for n=3
- now we have **6 combination of prev numbers** so lets pick one of them (P1P2D1D2) and try to add P3 and D3 to it
- no of ways to add P3 D3 together are: `(__P1P2D1D2, P1__P2D1D2, P1P2__D1D2, P1P2D1__D2, P1P2D1__D2)` = 5
- so ans = 5
- now we can fix P3 before P1(P3P1P2D1D2) and check for no of ways D3 can come: `P3P1_P2D1D2, P3P1P2_D1D2, P3P1P2D1_D2, P3P1P2D1D2_` = 4
- so ans = 5+4
- as seen from n=2 we can ans would be sum of no till 5 (5+4+3+2+1) = 25
- **Here we checked for one prev combination (P1P2D1D2). There were total 6 combinations so the ans would be =6*(5+4+3+2+1) = 90**
- for n=4
- we can conclude the ans would be = 90*(7+6+5+4+3+2+1) = 2520
